You're in *great shape*â€”youâ€™ve already implemented nearly everything required by the assignment! Let's now structure how to **wrap up your ROF project** for submission (report, figures, conclusions, etc.). Here's your roadmap:

---

## âœ… **What You've Already Done**

You've **completed or exceeded** these required components:

| Task                                            | Status                                        |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `smooth_image_rof.m` â€“ Vectorized solver        | âœ… Implemented and GPU/CPU adaptive            |
| `calculate_msd.m` â€“ Computes MSD                | âœ… Complete with dispatch to CPU/GPU           |
| Batch parameter sweeps                          | âœ… `smart_grid_search`, `foreach_plane_search` |
| GPU memory batching                             | âœ… Done in `gpu_plane_sweep.m`                 |
| Parallel CPU fallback                           | âœ… Implemented using `parfor` and `parpool`    |
| Utility functions (noise, plotting, assertions) | âœ… Clean and complete                          |
| Raw image loading from `.ARW`                   | âœ… Used `rawread` and `raw2planar` correctly   |

## ðŸ§¾ **Remaining Deliverables**

To finish the assignment, focus on these:

### 1. **Plots and Analysis**

> Required: Generate the 3D MSD plots for the 4 color planes.

Use `plot_msd_surface.m` and loop over the `msdCube(:,:,p)` for each color plane. Example plotting script:

```matlab
load rof_results_singlepool.mat

figure;
t = tiledlayout(2,2, 'Padding','compact','TileSpacing','compact');

for p = 1:4
    nexttile;
    plot_msd_surface(msdCube(:,:,p), lambda, epsilon);
    title(sprintf('Plane %d (R/G/G/B)', p));
end

sgtitle('MSD vs (\lambda, \epsilon) for each Bayer plane');
```

If you want the "stacked transparent surface" plot, we can write a `plot_stacked_surfaces` function using `surf(..., 'FaceAlpha', ...)`.

---

### 2. **Written Report**

> Required: Include a brief write-up with the following sections.

You can write this in LaTeX (best) or Markdown. Suggested outline:

#### A. Introduction

* Brief explanation of ROF restoration
* Context: digital images, Bayer mosaic, color planes

#### B. Method

* Discretization and implementation of the Euler-Lagrange equation
* Vectorization
* GPU/CPU batching
* Explanation of `smooth_image_rof` and `calculate_msd`

#### C. Results

* MSD surfaces for each color plane
* Determine which plane is noisiest and cleanest
* Show plots (embed them if LaTeX)

#### D. Discussion

* Observation: likely the blue channel is noisiest (or check)
* Educated guess: Bayer has 2 green pixels per 2Ã—2 cell for better luminance sensitivity (human eyes are more sensitive to green)

### 3. **File Packaging**

> Prepare your submission directory:

Suggested folder structure:

```

â”œâ”€â”€ smooth_image_rof.m
â”œâ”€â”€ calculate_msd.m
â”œâ”€â”€ cpu_plane_sweep.m

Let me know if you'd like:

* âœ… A LaTeX report template to get you started
* âœ… Help generating stacked surface plots
* âœ… Export code to generate figures automatically
* âœ… Shell script to zip and upload your directory

### âœ… Next Step Recommendation

Would you like me to:

1. Draft the LaTeX `report.tex` template for your submission?
2. Generate the `plot_stacked_surfaces.m` script?
3. Help you zip everything for turning in?

Let me know how you'd like to proceed ðŸ“¦ðŸ“ŠðŸ§
